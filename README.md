# Complex Computer Vision Systems
Hello, I have built some computer vision systems using python and golang. Find a list below:


- A simple receipt / document scanner that enhances quality of photos taken from documents.
- A license plate recognition system
- Soduku Solver
- Parking Lane Detector
- Simple People Detector
- Colour Detection
- Image Colour Contrast (Foreground / Background) Score Calculator - For web accessability

The list will be updated here and there with new projects. If you have any other ideas, email: rndmemex@cantab.net

**NOTE**: I am not a computer scientist, this is just a hobby :/ if you spot any mistake and would like to point them out, email me. Thank you :D
