# Computer Vision Systems
Hello, I have built some computer vision systems using python and golang. Find a list below:


- A simple receipt / document scanner that enhances quality of photos taken from documents.
- A license plate recognition system
- Soduku Solver
- Parking Lane Detector
- Simple People Detector
- Colour Detection
- Image Colour Contrast (Foreground / Background) Score Calculator - For web accessability

I will update my list as I have more prjects to work on
